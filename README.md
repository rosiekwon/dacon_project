## 2. Wine Quality Data Set

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
Data Set Information:

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

  Input variables (based on physicochemical tests)

    fixed acidity

    volatile acidity

    citric acid

    residual sugar

    chlorides

    free sulfur dioxide

    total sulfur dioxide

    density

    pH

    sulphates

    alcohol

  Output variable (based on sensory data):

    quality (score between 0 and 10)
